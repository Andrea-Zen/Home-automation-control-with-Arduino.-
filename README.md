Features
Temperature and Humidity Monitoring: Uses a DHT22 sensor to measure and display values.
Air Quality Detection: Monitors air quality using an MQ-135 gas sensor and sends email alerts if levels exceed a threshold.
Light Level Monitoring: Uses an LDR to measure ambient light.
Burglar Alarm: Detects motion using a PIR sensor and sends an email alert when triggered.
Relay Control: Two relays can be turned on/off manually or scheduled for specific times.
Event Log: Maintains a log of activities and events.
Web Interface: Provides a real-time dashboard for sensor readings, relay control, and logs.
Components Required
Arduino Uno or compatible board
ESP8266 Wi-Fi Module
DHT22 Sensor (for temperature and humidity)
MQ-135 Gas Sensor
PIR Motion Sensor
LDR (Light Dependent Resistor)
2 Relay Modules
RTC Module (Real-Time Clock)
Resistors, jumper wires, breadboard
How It Works
Wi-Fi Connection: Connects to a Wi-Fi network and hosts a web server to provide a control interface.
Sensor Data: Collects data from sensors (temperature, humidity, air quality, light, and motion).
Relay Control: Allows manual and scheduled control of relays for devices like lights or fans.
Email Notifications: Sends email alerts for air quality and motion detection events.
Historical Data: Stores the last 10 readings of temperature, humidity, and air quality for display on a web interface.
Event Logging: Logs up to 100 events, such as relay activations or motion detections.
Setting Up the Code
Libraries to Install:

DHT.h (for temperature and humidity)
MQ135.h (for gas sensor)
RTClib.h (for RTC module)
ESP8266WiFi.h (for Wi-Fi connectivity)
SMTPClient.h (for email notifications)
ArduinoJson.h (for JSON parsing)
Wi-Fi Configuration:
Replace the placeholders YOUR_SSID and YOUR_PASSWORD in the code with your Wi-Fi credentials.

Email Setup:
Replace emailRecipient and emailPassword with your email address and password for sending alerts.

Hardware Connections:

Connect the sensors and relays to the specified pins in the code.
Ensure proper power supply for the ESP8266 module.
Web Interface
Access the web interface by entering the ESP8266â€™s IP address in a browser.
Features:
View real-time sensor readings (temperature, humidity, air quality, and light levels).
Control relays (turn on/off or schedule).
View historical graphs for temperature and air quality.
View and clear the event log.
Email Alerts
Air Quality: If the air quality exceeds the threshold (300 PPM), an email alert is sent.
Motion Detection: If the PIR sensor detects motion, an email alert is sent immediately.
Future Improvements
Add a smartphone app for remote control.
Expand relay control to more devices.
Integrate voice commands using a virtual assistant (e.g., Alexa, Google Assistant).
